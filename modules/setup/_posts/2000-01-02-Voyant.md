[Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org){:target="_blank"} is a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. It is a scholarly project that is designed to facilitate reading and interpretive practices for digital humanities students and scholars as well as for the general public.

We will be using Voyant for exploratory text analysis in this workshop.

You do not need to install anything in order to use Voyant. It is accessible in the browser.
