## Getting Started with Taguette for Qualitative Research

Taguette is a free and open-source tool for qualitative research. Taguette allows us to import our research materials, highlight and tag quotes, and export the results from Taguette.

### Downloading and installing Taguette
Taguette works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Follow the [guide](https://www.taguette.org/install.html) to download and install Taguette for your operating system.

We will be running Taguette locally.

Once we have downloaded and installed Taguette on our computer, double-click the Taguette icon to start it up.  The command line will pop up and be running, and Taguette should open in the web browser. Do leave the terminal running. If you exit the terminal, Taguette will stop.

### Creating a project

Let's create a new project.

We named it *vaccination expectations*, but you can always change it to something else.

If you have exported a project before, you can also import that project directly and continue to work on it.

### Exporting results

After you've done your work highlighting materials in Taguette, you can export in a variety of ways -- your whole project, codebook, all your highlighted quotes (or ones for a specific tag!), and highlighted documents.
