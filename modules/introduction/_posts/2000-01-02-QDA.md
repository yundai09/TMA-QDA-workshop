## Qualitative data analysis for social science

Qualitative research seeks to understand a research problem from the perspectives of the subject or local population it involves rather than the researcher. 

> Qualitative research is especially effective in obtaining culturally specific information about the values, opinions, behaviors, and social contexts of particular populations. (Mack et al., 2005, p. 1)
