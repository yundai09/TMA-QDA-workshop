## Project design and procedure

<br>

The design of this research project is illustrated below. It showcases the entire workflow of the project.

However, the focus of this workshop is on *analyzing data*. 

Imagine in a real world case, it could be the step where you have already done with your interviews and you have the transcripts ready in textual formats. You start to think about how to analyze those texts. From a toolbox of analytic tools, would you choose the text mining/analytics techniques, qualitative data analysis methods, or a mixture of both?
