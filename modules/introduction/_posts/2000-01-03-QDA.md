## Qualitative research for social science

Qualitative research seeks to understand a research problem from the perspectives of the subject rather than the researcher. Qualitative methods tend to ask *open-ended* questions that participants are free to respond and in greater detail than is typically the case with quantitative methods. The responses can be "meaningful and culturally salient to the participant, unanticipated by the researcher, and rich and explanatory in nature" (Mack et al., 2005, p. 4).

Examples of qualitative research methods include participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups. These methods generate data that can be field notes, audio recordings, video recordings, and transcripts. Additionally, qualitative data could also include documents. (Patton, 2002, p. 4)

### Why *qualitative*?
Qualitative research is most effective in studying the behaviors, beliefs, opinions, emotions, and relationships of individuals, and the social contexts of particular populations, including social norms, socioeconomic status, gender roles, ethnicity, and religion (Mack et al., 2005, p. 1).

### Is qualitative research scientific?

Qualitative research is *scientific*. 

The degree of flexibility among methods used in qualitative research is not an indication of how scientifically rigorous a method is. Rather, it reflects the kind of understanding of the problem that is being pursued using the method.

> It 
> * seeks answers to a question
> * systematically uses a predefined set of procedures to answer the question
> * collects evidence
> * produces findings that were not determined in advance
> * produces findings that are applicable beyond the immediate boundaries of the study 

(Mack et al., 2005, p. 1,4)
