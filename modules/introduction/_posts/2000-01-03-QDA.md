## Qualitative research for social science

<br>

Qualitative research seeks to understand a research problem from the perspectives of the subject rather than the researcher. The relationship between the researcher and the participant is also less formal than in quantitative research. Qualitative researchers see reality as being subjective and multiple, as seen by the subjects. In qualitative research, values and biases are recognized and openly discussed. Researchers use inductive logic to study the topic within its political, social and cultural context, involving an interpretive approach to the world, and developing a holistic account of the problem under study (Creswell, 2007, p. 16-19, 23-24, 36-39; Mack et al., 2005, p. 3-4). 

Forms of qualitative information include interviews, observations,documents, and audiovisual materials. Examples of qualitative research methods include participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups (Creswell, 2007, p. 40-41; Patton, 2002, p. 4).

Qualitative research is flexible. But it requires a strong committment, demanding of time in the field and analyzing the data (Creswell, 2007, p. 40-41).

### Why qualitative?
Qualitative research is most effective in studying the behaviors, beliefs, opinions, emotions, and relationships of individuals, and the social contexts of particular populations, including social norms, socioeconomic status, gender roles, ethnicity, and religion (Mack et al., 2005, p. 1). 

Qualitative approaches are useful in exploratory research. Qualitative research is also useful when we need details, where the open-ended questions allow participants to respond more freely and in greater detail than is typically the case with quantitative methods. Additionally, qualitative research is useful when combined with quantitative research, or when quantitative research does not fit the problem under study (Mack et al., 2005, p. 3-4; Creswell, 2007, p. 39-41).

### Is qualitative research scientific?

Qualitative research is *scientific*. It starts with a question and seeks answers to it; it uses a predefined set of procedures to answer the question; it gathers data and collects evidence; and it produces findings in a report (Mack et al., 2005, p. 1; Creswell, 2007, p. 41). 

The degree of flexibility among methods used in qualitative research is not an indication of how scientifically rigorous a method is. Rather, it reflects the kind of understanding of the problem that is being pursued using the method (Mack et al., 2005, p. 4).
