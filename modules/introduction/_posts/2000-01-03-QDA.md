## Qualitative research for social science

Qualitative research seeks to understand a research problem from the perspectives of the subject rather than the researcher. Qualitative researchers see reality as being subjective and multiple, as seen by the subjects. Values and biases are recognized and openly discussed. Methodologically, qualitative researchers use inductive logic and study the topic within its political, social and cultural context, involving an interpretive approach to the world, and developing a holistic account of the problem under study. The relationship between the researcher and the participant is also less formal than in quantitative research (Creswell, 2007, p. 16-19, 23-24, 36-39; Mack et al., 2005, p. 3-4). 

Examples of qualitative research methods include participant observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups. 

Forms of qualitative data include field notes, audio recordings, video recordings, and transcripts. Additionally, qualitative data could also include documents. (Patton, 2002, p. 4)

Qualitative research is flexible. But it requires a strong committment, demanding of time in the field and analyzing the data (Creswell, 2007, p. 40-41).

### Why *qualitative*?
Qualitative research is most effective in studying the behaviors, beliefs, opinions, emotions, and relationships of individuals, and the social contexts of particular populations, including social norms, socioeconomic status, gender roles, ethnicity, and religion (Mack et al., 2005, p. 1). 

It is useful in exploratory research and/or when we need details, where open-ended questions allow participants to respond more freely and in greater detail than is typically the case with quantitative methods. It is also useful when combined with quantitative research, or when quantitative research simply does not fit the problem under study (Mack et al., 2005, p. 3-4; Creswell, 2007, p. 39-41).

### Is qualitative research scientific?

Qualitative research is *scientific*. It starts with a question and seeks answers to it; it uses a predefined set of procedures to answer the question; it gathers data and collects evidence; and it produces findings in a report (Mack et al., 2005, p. 1; Creswell, 2007, p. 41). 

The degree of flexibility among methods used in qualitative research is not an indication of how scientifically rigorous a method is. Rather, it reflects the kind of understanding of the problem that is being pursued using the method (Mack et al., 2005, p. 4).

### Then how does qualitative research differ from quantitative research?
