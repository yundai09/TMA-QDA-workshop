## Procedure

This workshop showcases the procedure of this project, as described below. 

However, the focus is on *analyzing data*. Imagine in a real world case, it could be the step where you have already done with your interviews and you have the transcripts ready in textual formats. You start to think about how to analyze those texts. From a toolbox of analytic tools, would you choose the text mining/analytics techniques, qualitative data analysis methods, or a mixture of both?
