## Workflow

This workshop follows the workflow below to introduce both text mining/analytics and qualitative approaches to textual data. The focus is on *analyzing data*. 

Imagine in a real world case, it would be the step where you have already done with your interviews and you have the transcripts ready in textual formats. You start to think about how to analyze those texts.
