## Workflow

This workshop showcases the entire workflow of the project, as described below. However, the focus is on *analyzing data*. 

Imagine in a real world case, it would be the step where you have already done with your interviews and you have the transcripts ready in textual formats. You start to think about how to analyze those texts. In a toolbox of analytic techniques, would you use the text mining/analytics techniques, qualitative approaches, or both?
