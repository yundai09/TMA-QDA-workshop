## What is your research question?

First of all, a research project starts with a research question. 

Take some time to read those documents. Think about the questions you want to ask about these documents.

## Quantitative? Qualitative?

Then think about if your research questions are **quantitative** or **qualitative** in nature.

For instance, is this question *Do universities in blue states tend to require vaccination more than universities in red states?* quantitative or qualitative? Red or blue states may be further specified by the ratios of voting for Biden or Trump in 2020.

What about "Do universities that do not require vaccination talk more about responsibility of community members?"
