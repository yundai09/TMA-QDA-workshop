## Sampling

**Sampling frame:** a list of U.S. universities from the Times Higher Education World University Rankings

**Goal:** selecting equal number of universities in "red" and "blue" states from the top 50 universities

**Sampling strategy:** selecting all 10 universities in "red" states from the top 50 and randomly sampling 10 universities in "blue" states from the remaining 40 universities

Note: Among the top 50 universities, we only got 10 universities residing in "red" states. Therefore, the sample is not balanced.

**Sample size:** resulting number of universities to be investigated (20)
