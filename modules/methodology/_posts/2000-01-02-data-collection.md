## Type of texts

Vaccination expectations may be conveyed in various formats of texts. It could be *vaccination FAQs*, usually on the webpages of the departmemts of health and wellness, or *news articles*.

We focus on one single type of text, **community message**, to control for the effects from the type of documents on the expression of vaccination expectations.

Occasionally, when a community message is not clear enough about the university's vaccination expectation, we use additional text to validate our understanding (e.g. news article).

## Sampling

We take a sample from all community messages following the procedures below.

**Sampling frame:** a list of U.S. universities from the Times Higher Education World University Rankings

**Goal:** selecting equal number of universities in "red" and "blue" states from the top 50 universities

**Sampling strategy:** selecting all 10 universities in "red" states from the top 50 and randomly sampling 10 universities in "blue" states from the remaining 40 universities

Note: Among the top 50 universities, we only got 10 universities residing in "red" states. Therefore, the sample is not balanced.

**Sample size:** resulting number of universities to be investigated (20)

## Document level information

One university can have more than one community messages because a university may separately send messages to students and employees, or update the previous document. The unit of analysis in this workshop is **document**, not university, which is each community message. 

Therefore, we also collected information associated with each community message, including 

* university name
* global and national ranks of the university
* city, county, state
* political orientation
* published date, retrieved date of the community message

These information could help us contextualize our analysis.
