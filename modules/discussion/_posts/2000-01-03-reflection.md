## Quantitative or qualitative? 

<br>

> On the one hand, qualitative data is often presented as ‘richer’ and ‘more valid’ than quantitative data. On the other hand, it is often dismissed as ‘too subjective’ because assessments are not made in terms of established standards. In practice, this implies an unnecessary polarization between the different types of data. We have to consider the reliability and validity of whatever measures we choose.
