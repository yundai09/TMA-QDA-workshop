title: Limitations

## Data cleaning
  * Especially important for TM/A

<br>

## Sampling
  * Sample size is very small; not many variations revealed
  * Only sampled one year (2020), while social factors are deeply historical
  * Biased sample: sampled from top 50 universities

<br>
 
## Analysis
  * Social, political and institutional contexts of vaccination expectations not examined
  * What's beyond the summary statistics?
  * Metrics not weighted when a university has more than one document

<br>

## Software (TM/A)
  * Voyant is designed for an audience in mind; therefore its built-in algorithms serves that purpose
  * Limited by the available features in the software and its built-in algorithms do not allow for much customization

<br>

## Approach and perspective
For QDA, we used a mixed method approach, which looked at our data through variables.
