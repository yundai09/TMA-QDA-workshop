## Mixed methods analysis

<br>

### Counting codes

We can generate a frequency table of codes in Taguette to count occurrence of the themes in our documents that we have identified.

We can also collect number of text chunks associated with each code as an indicator of participant interest in a code Creswell, 2007, p. 152).

### Building relationships among codes

As a final stage of our research desigh, we develop hypotheses to specify the relationship among categories, or variables. 

We use codes attached to each document as variables to perform document level analysis.

* Are there more universities in blue states require vaccination than universities in red states? Is this difference significant?
* Do universities in blue states tend to require vaccination than universities in red states (blue/red further operationalized) ?
* Do universities in blue states talk more about {code} than universities in red states?
* Do universities that require vaccination tend to talk more about {code} than the universities that do not require vaccination?
