## Procedures for conducting grounded theory research

<br>

Following Creswell (2007, p. 64-67), the procedures for conducting grounded theory research is illustrated below.

<br>

### Grounded theory or not?

Think about if the grounded theory approach (or another approach) is suited to study the research problem.

<br>

### Theoretical sampling
The participants/documents are theoretically chosen to help the researcher form the theory. 

How many passes one makes to the field depends on whether the categories of information become saturated and whether the theory is elaborated in all of its complexity. This process of taking information from data collection and comparing it to emerging categories is called the constant comparative method of data analysis.

### Data collection

Data collection is a "zigzag" process: out to the field to gather information, into the office to analyze the data, back to the field to gather more information, into the office, and so forth. 

The focus is on understanding how individuals experience the process and identifying the steps in the process.

The point is to gather enough information to fully develop (or saturate) the model.

### Analysis

The analysis of the data proceeds in stages. 

<br>

#### Open coding

In open coding, the
researcher forms categories of information about the phenomenon being
studied by segmenting information. Within each category, the investigator
finds several properties, or subcategories, and looks for data to dimensionalize,
or show the extreme possibilities on a continuum of, the property.

The researcher begins with open coding, coding the data for its major categories of information. From this coding, axial coding emerges in which the researcher identifies one open coding category to focus on (called the "core" phenomenon), and then goes back to the data and create categories around this core phenomenon.

Strauss and Corbin (1990) prescribe the types of categories identified around the core phenomenon. They consist of causal conditions (what factors caused the core phenomenon), strategies (actions taken in response to the core phenomenon), contextual and intervening conditions (broad and specific situational factors that influence the strategies), and consequences (outcomes from using the strategies).

<br>

#### Selective coding

The final step, then, is selective coding, in which the researcher takes the model and develops propositions (or hypotheses) that interrelate the categories in the model or assembles a story that describes the interrelationship of categories in the model. This theory, developed by the researcher, is articulated toward the end of a study and can assume several forms, such as a narrative statement (Strauss & Corbin, 1990), a visual picture (Morrow & Smith, 1995), or a series of hypotheses or propositions.
