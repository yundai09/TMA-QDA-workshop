## Procedures for conducting grounded theory research

<br>

Following Creswell (2007, p. 64-67), the procedures for conducting grounded theory research is illustrated below.

<br>

### What perspective and approach to take?

First, think about if a theory or an approach is suited to study the research problem. 

In our case, we take the grounded theory approach to study vaccination expectations and intend to form an explanation of the causes and consequences of those various expectations.

<br>

### Theoretical sampling
In a grounded theory approach, the participants can be theoretically chosen to help the researcher form the theory. This is called *theoretical sampling*. 

We explained our sampling approach in the section *Methodology*. 

<br>

### Data collection

Data collection evolves in a "zigzag" process: out to the field to gather information, into the office to analyze the data, back to the field to gather more information, into the office, and so forth. 

The focus is on understanding how individuals experience the process and identifying the steps in the process.

The goal is to gather enough information to fully elaborate a theory, when the categories of information become saturated.

### Analysis

The analysis of the data proceeds in stages. 

<br>

#### Open coding

Researchers begin with open coding to form major categories of information about the phenomenon being studied.

<br>

#### Axial coding

Next, researchers find several subcategories to focus on around the core phenomenon.

The types of categories identified around the core phenomenon can be causal conditions (what factors caused the core phenomenon), strategies (actions taken in response to the core phenomenon), contextual and intervening conditions (broad and specific situational factors that influence the strategies), and consequences (outcomes from using the strategies).

<br>

#### Selective coding

The final step is selective coding to articulate a theory. Researchers connect the categories and develop hypotheses on relationships among the categories.

<br>

#### Memoing

During coding, researchers may write down ideas about evolving theory throughout the process of open, axial, and selective coding.

<br>

### What's next?
The theory generated from the above process may be tested later with quantitative data to determine if it can be generalized to a population. 

Alternatively, the study may end at this point with the generation of a theory as the goal of the research.
