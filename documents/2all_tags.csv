172,0723_Pitt,risk of covid,"As the start of the fall term nears, concerns about COVID-19—and especially the new fast-spreading delta variant—are rising. It seems only natural to question if the plans we have been making for fall will protect our students, faculty and staff."
173,0723_Pitt,institutional strategy,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, the University of Pittsburgh’s fundamental strategy has focused on minimizing the risk of infection related to the coronavirus while maximizing our ability to carry out our mission activities of teaching, research and service. Before highlighting the difference in our approach for this fall, let me quickly summarize the basics that continue to guide us. Our virus control program can be divided into roughly three approaches, differing by how targeted the measures are. In order of increasing specificity, they are: •  Global mitigation, which involves measures taken by everyone to lower the risk of person-to-person transmission of the virus. Familiar examples include social distancing and avoiding large gatherings, universal use of face coverings, good hand hygiene, etc. •  Containment, which involves measures— taken by those infected or potentially exposed —to lower the risk of transmission. Examples include testing to identify infection, contact tracing to identify exposures, and the use of isolation and quarantines. •  Immunization, which stimulates an immune response in each individual that protects against serious illness and lowers the risk of transmission. The COVID-19 vaccines widely available today have proven to be safe and highly effective—including against the prevailing delta variant. These measures work. Last year, using only global mitigation and containment strategies, we were able to control the virus in our on-campus environment. Today, with the widespread availability of effective and safe vaccines, we can further tailor our mitigation and containment strategies to achieve a very low risk of transmission on our campuses, even with the new delta variant."
174,0723_Pitt,community,"Vaccines are a game-changer. They protect individuals from serious illness, cut the risk of transmission and collectively reduce our reliance on global mitigation approaches in favor of targeted containment strategies. This, in turn, minimizes the disruptions to our program and activities while ensuring the safety of everyone on our campuses."

I’m also encouraged by the resilience I see each day on campus and the work so many of you are doing to support our returning students. I’ve spoken with faculty members this week who are both preparing to teach in person and making adjustments to reduce density in their classrooms. I’ve heard from staff members (many of whom have been on campus for months) who are readying the Forty Acres for the fall, checking in students, serving meals, and maintaining our beautiful grounds. I was even stopped this morning by some new students who were out on a scavenger hunt as part of their orientation. I thank you for everything you are doing and for your commitment to our University of Texas community."

Scientists have learned a significant amount about the Delta variant, and this research underscores why being vaccinated is critical to combating COVID-19. Studies show that the Delta variant can be orders of magnitude (in one study, 1,000 times) more severe and it affects younger people in higher percentages than the original coronavirus strain. Additionally, vaccinated individuals can transmit the Delta variant – at least for the first few days that they are infected – even if they are not sick themselves. These factors combined mean it is also much more transmissible than the initial strains of COVID-19. The good news is that vaccinated individuals, though they can get COVID-19, are less contagious than unvaccinated individuals and they are significantly less likely to be hospitalized or die from the virus. Masks also continue to be an effective tool at combating the spread of COVID-19. That is why we are implementing our vaccine requirement with urgency as well as continuing our protocol to require everyone to wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status."
