#### About this workshop
Using the same texts, this workshop applies both text mining/analytics (TM/A) and qualitative data analysis (QDA) approaches to examine the documents on vaccination expectations in a sample of U.S. universities across "blue" and "red" states. 

This workshop consists of two parts. The first part introduces text mining/analytics techniques using a web-interfacing tool, Voyant, for exploratory analysis. The second part introduces qualitative data analysis using an open source software, Taguette. Specifically, this part relies on the grounded theory to develop a mixed method approach to analyze the texts. 

The two sessions, held back-to-back, compare and contrast the TM/A and QDA approaches towards the same materials through demonstration and hands-on exercises. No prior knowledge of either method is required.
